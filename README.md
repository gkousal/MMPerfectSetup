# MMPerfectSetup
This is just a place where I keep an updated .dll for having a perfect car setup on the game Motorsport Manager.

You should place this file in \Steam\steamapps\common\Motorsport Manager\MM_Data\Managed, or wherever you have installed Motorsport Manager, inside its MM_Data\Managed folder. You will find that this folder is full of '*.dll'.

Remember to backup you original 'Assembly-CSharp.dll' file, in case something goes wrong, so you have the option to just replace the file with the original one, without having to reinstall the game.

I dont take credit of this, i just made the necessary changes so it works with the latest version of Motorsport Manager (since the last one available is like 3 years old).

Due credit goes to https://github.com/Pixelatedza/MMAE for making this possible.
